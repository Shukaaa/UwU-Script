# UwU-Script

Hi there! Welcome to my UwU-Script repository!

## Project Description

UwU-Script is a fun and quirky interpreted scripting language based on Java.
The language has a unique feature of consisting solely of function calls, and is one of the most *space-sensitive* languages out there.
Additionally, UwU-Script is adorned with many anime and Japanese references, making it a weird and unique project to work on.

## Motivation

As a beginner in programming, I created UwU-Script as a personal project to learn new skills and have fun while doing so.
I wanted to challenge myself to develop a unique and quirky scripting language that could make people smile.
